## What is SCA-Goat?
dfdf
SCAGoat is an application for Software Composition Analysis (SCA) that focuses on vulnerable and compromised JAR dependencies used in development code, providing users with hands-on learning opportunities to understand potential attack scenarios. It is designed to identify vulnerabilities that may arise from using vulnerable JAR files.

## Presented at:
- [DC32: Demo Labs](https://forum.defcon.org/node/249617)
- [Appsec Village: Arsenal](https://www.appsecvillage.com/events/dc-2024/arsenal-scagoat-661284)

## What All CVE Covered?

The CVEs covered under SCAGoat are primarily critical and high severity, which have a CVSS score of 9. This aid in understanding the vulnerable package being used and its potential for exploitation. 

In addition, there is one compromised package, that lacks a CVE, but is malicious by nature and cannot be detected with traditional SCA scanners.
